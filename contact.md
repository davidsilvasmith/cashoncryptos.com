How can we work together?

I'm a sales guy, business owner, and former software developer.

My unique skill-set in the cryptocurrency space is being able to talk to anyone about bitcoin and how it can benefit their business. From talking to a board room to HR people, to PR, to software developers.

I'm currently focused on Bitcoin Education

 * I own [So Whats Bitcoin](http://www.sowhatsbitcoin.com) - explaining bitcoin to everyone
 * I speak at bitcoin conferences like [Coin Congress Asia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-PXjJLF-bo), [North Amerian Bitcoin Expo](http://www.btcchicago.com), and [Coin Congress USA](http://usa.coincongress.org/)
 * I write [positive bitcoin articles](http://www.benzinga.com/author/david-smith) for Benzinga.
 * I help bitcoin investors achieve [their financial](http://www.marketfy.com/product/cash-on-cryptos/) goals with bitcoin.
